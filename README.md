# -IrisDatasetPlot
tools : install scipy, numpy,matplotlib and sci-kit learn.
use any IDE you want well. can use jupyter notebook or IDLE

its a scatterplot of the iris dataset
load iris dataset in pattern recognition using scikit-learn   *** from sklearn.datasets import load_iris iris = load_iris() **
The iris dataset contains 3 classes of 50 instances each ,a total of 150 observations of the iris flower specifying some measurements: sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.
Each class refers to the type of iris plant.
The three classes are Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica. One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are NOT linearly separable from each other.
The goal is to predict the class of the iris plant. Hence, it is said to be supervised learning.

The task in hand : This is a permutation problem. From 4 features choose 2 which equals 12
choices in total. That is why there are 12 subplots in total.
